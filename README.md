WHAT IS QR CODE??

A QR code, or Quick Response code, is a two-dimensional barcode that contains information that can be read by a smartphone's camera. QR codes are made up of black and white pixels that store data for a machine to read, and the pattern of pixels can be translated into human-readable information. The information can include a URL, phone number, contact information, SMS, product information, or social media links
